.. py:class:: QuantizationAwareTrainingCallbacks(conf=None, model=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseCallbacks`

   This is the class for callbacks of quantization aware training.

   This design is mainly for Quantization-Aware Training.
   In this class will apply all hooks for Quantization-Aware Training.


.. py:class:: DistillationCallbacks(conf=None, model=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseCallbacks`

   Distillation class derived from Component class.

   Distillation class abstracted the pipeline of knowledge distillation,
   transfer the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model.

   :param conf: Distillation_Conf containing teacher model, distillation criterion etc.
   :param model: Student model.

   .. attribute:: _epoch_ran

      A integer indicating how much epochs ran.

   .. attribute:: eval_frequency

      The frequency for doing evaluation of the student model
      in terms of epoch.

   .. attribute:: best_score

      The best metric of the student model in the training.

   .. attribute:: best_model

      The best student model found in the training.

   .. py:property:: criterion

      Getter of criterion.

      :returns: The criterion used in the distillation process.

   .. py:property:: teacher_model

      Getter of the teacher model.

      :returns: The teacher model used in the distillation process.

   .. py:property:: student_model

      Getter of the student model.

      :returns: The student model used in the distillation process.

   .. py:property:: train_cfg

      Getter of the train configuration.

      :returns: The train configuration used in the distillation process.

   .. py:method:: init_train_cfg()

      Initialize the training configuration.


   .. py:method:: create_criterion()

      Create the criterion for training.


   .. py:method:: generate_hooks()

      Register hooks for distillation.

      Register necessary hooks for distillation pipeline.



.. py:class:: PruningCallbacks(conf=None, model=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseCallbacks`

   This is the class for callbacks of pruning object.

   In this class will apply all hooks for Pruning.

   .. py:method:: on_train_end()

      Be called after the end of training.


   .. py:method:: generate_hooks()

      Register hooks for pruning.
